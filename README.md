Fyyur Project
-----

## Introduction

Fyyur is a musical venue and artist booking site that facilitates the discovery and bookings of shows between local performing artists and venues. This site lets you list new artists and venues, discover them, and list shows with artists as a venue owner.

Project was to build out the data models to power the API endpoints for the Fyyur site by connecting to a PostgreSQL database for storing, querying, and creating information about artists and venues on Fyyur.


## Tech Stack (Dependencies)

### 1. Backend Dependencies
 * **virtualenv** as a tool to create isolated Python environments
 * **SQLAlchemy ORM** to be our ORM library of choice
 * **PostgreSQL** as our database of choice
 * **Python3** and **Flask** as our server language and server framework
 * **Flask-Migrate** for creating and running schema migrations
You can download and install the dependencies mentioned above using `pip` 

### 2. Frontend Dependencies
You must have the **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Javascript** with [Bootstrap 3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/customize/) for the website's frontend. Bootstrap can only be installed by Node Package Manager (NPM). Therefore, if not already, download and install the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Windows users must run the executable as an Administrator, and restart the computer after installation. After successfully installing the Node, verify the installation as shown below.
```
node -v
npm -v
```
Install [Bootstrap 3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/getting-started/) for the website's frontend:
```
npm init -y
npm install bootstrap@3
```

#### Data Handling with `Flask-WTF` Forms
The starter codes use an interactive form builder library called [Flask-WTF](https://flask-wtf.readthedocs.io/). This library provides useful functionality, such as form validation and error handling. You can peruse the Show, Venue, and Artist form builders in `forms.py` file. The WTForms are instantiated in the `app.py` file. For example, in the `create_shows()` function, the Show form is instantiated from the command: `form = ShowForm()`. To manage the request from Flask-WTF form, each field from the form has a `data` attribute containing the value from user input. For example, to handle the `venue_id` data from the Venue form, you can use: `show = Show(venue_id=form.venue_id.data)`, instead of using `request.form['venue_id']`.


## Development Setup
1. **Download the project starter code locally**

2. **Create an empty repository in your Github account online.

3. **Initialize and activate a virtualenv using:**

4. **Install the dependencies:**
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. **Run the development server:**
```
export FLASK_APP=myapp
export FLASK_ENV=development # enables debug mode
python3 app.py
```

6. **Verify on the Browser**<br>
